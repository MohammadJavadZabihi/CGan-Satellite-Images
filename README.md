# CGan-Satellite-Images
In this notebook, an attempt has been made to generate new images using GAN networks and the CGAN algorithm, but with a difference. The difference is that we provide a satellite image as input, and the output provides us with its digital map.
However, it should be noted that due to limited resources, I was unable to fully train the model. Nevertheless, the code was functioning correctly, so you can easily use it by inserting the code and downloading the relevant dataset.
